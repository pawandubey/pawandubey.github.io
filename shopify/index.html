                    <p>I am a Computer Science Senior at <a href="http://manipal.edu/mit.html"> &nbsp;Manipal Institute of Technology, India.</a> Here, I spend my time learning and building new things, while earning the credits in my free time.</p>
                    <p>I <i class="fa fa-heart" style="color:red"></i> programming in Java and Ruby and I think I would make a perfect match for Shopify. So I decided to follow your advice, and <a href="http://throw-out-your-resume.com/">threw out my cover letter for this page.</a></p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>I started learning to program when I was in the third grade, even though I did not have a computer yet. The experience stuck with me and it has since motivated me to most of my major achievements in my life. Programming is my first love <i class="fa fa-heart" style="color:red"></i>.</p>
                    <p>I have written over 10000 lines of code in Java, making things like an extremely fast <a href="https://github.com/pawandubey/griffin">static site generator</a> and a miniature search engine, amongst other things in the process.</p>
                    <p>More recently, I have been <a href="https://github.com/pawandubey/ruby_experiments">dabbling with Ruby and Rails</a>, which I also used at my last internship at <a href="https://adwyze.com">AdWyze</a>, which is an advertisement analytics <i class="fa fa-bar-chart" style="color:green"></i> startup, where I worked on multiple features of their Rails backend, including the currency conversion module and tag bundling system.</p>
                    <p>I am also a national champion quizzer and also the founder of the <a href="https://manipal.acm.org">ACM Student Chapter of my University</a>. I am actively involved in efforts to make technology more accessible to as many people as possible.</p>

                    <p>I am also an active contributor to Open Source projects like JBoss and Spacemacs. I was a Google Summer of Code intern after my freshman year and most of the code I produce ends up at <a href="https://github.com/pawandubey">my <i class="fa fa-github"></i> github.</a></p>
                    <p>Besides that, I also enjoy watching soccer and playing Civilization V in my free time (which is all the time).</p>

                    <p>I have a knack for getting things done, and getting them done the right way. Although I don't cut any corners, I am very effective at arriving at pragmatic solutions to problems. I am extremely work-focused when on the job, but I can unwind like a couch potato when I have to.</p>
                    <p>Combined with my recent experience with Rails and long term experience with leadership, I really think I would fit right in at Shopify's high voltage environment!</p>
